Página cargandoKaleidersWhat we doCultureOur ProductsContactBlogJuanfran AlcántaraEngineer Sometimes frontend, sometimes backend, since I was young I love programming, at first creating small games with C++, now creating large web applications with javascript. Always looking for new and better ways to enjoy programming.  Heavy music (¡Pantera!), comics (Sandman, Akira...), read (Asimov, Lovecraft...), my favorite books are "Dracula" and "Foundation", strategy games and board games.
